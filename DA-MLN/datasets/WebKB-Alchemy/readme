This data and this README has been adapted from
http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~craven/webkb to work with Alchemy.
This directory contains the "University Computer Science Department" data set
used for the experiments in the publications:

  @article{craven.mlj01

     ,title       = "Relational Learning with Statistical Predicate Invention:

               Hypertext Domains"

This data set consists of Web pages and hyperlinks collected from four
computer science departments: Cornell University, The University of
Texas, The University of Washington, and The University of Wisconsin.

The following files contain data in the input format for Alchemy:

   common.<univ>.db
      The background relations defined in this file are "LinkTo" which
      specifies hyperlink connections, and "AllWordsCapitalized" and
      "HasAlphanumericWord" which are Boolean predicates characterizing the
      anchor text of hyperlinks.

   page-words.<univ>.db
      This set of files provides a bag-of-words representation of the words
      that occur in pages in the data set.  Each predicate in these files
      specifies a stemmed word, and the instances of the predicate are those
      pages that contain the word.  There are four files in this set -- one
      for each university.  The files differ for each training/test partition
      because the vocabulary was pruned by considering the frequency of
      word occurrences only in the training set.

   anchor-words.<univ>.db
      This is the analogous set of files for words that occur in the anchor
      text of hyperlinks.

   neighborhood-words.<univ>.db
      This is the analogous set of files for words that occur in the
      "neighboring" text of hyperlinks.  The neighborhood of a hyperlink
      includes words in a single paragraph, list item, table entry, title
      or heading in which the hyperlink is contained.
		              
   page-classes.<univ>.db
      This set of files contains a set of predicates indicating the class
      of each page in the data set.  For training-set instances, the true
      class labels are used.  For test-set instances, predicted class labels
      are used.  These predictions were made using a method that combined
      statistical text classifiers with a URL-based clustering method.
      IMPORTANT: these files should be used only for the binary target
      relations (DepartmentOf, InstructorsOf, and membersOfProject).

   department-of.<univ>.db
      These are the training and test set instances for the target relation
      "DepartmentOf".

   instructors-of.<univ>.db
      These are the training and test set instances for the target relation
      "InstructorsOf".

   members-of-project.<univ>.db
      These are the training and test set instances for the target relation
      "MembersOfProject".

   student.<univ>.db 
      These are the training and test set instances for the target relation
      "StudentPage".

   course.<univ>.db 
      These are the training and test set instances for the target relation
      "CoursePage".

   research.project.<univ>.db 
      These are the training and test set instances for the target relation
      "ResearchProjectPage".

   faculty.<univ>.db
      These are the training and test set instances for the target relation
      "FacultyPage".
      
To set up an input file for Alchemy, you should 
concatenate the right set of files together.  For example, to train
on Cornell, Texas and Washington while testing on Wisconsin for the
"InstructorsOf" relation, you should concatenate the following files:
   common.db
   page-words.cornell.db
   page-words.texas.db
   page-words.washington.db
   anchor-words.cornell.db
   anchor-words.texas.db
   anchor-words.washington.db
   neighborhood-words.cornell.db
   neighborhood-words.texas.db
   neighborhood-words.washington.db
   page-classes.cornell.db
   page-classes.texas.db
   page-classes.washington.db
   instructors-of.cornell.db
   instructors-of.texas.db
   instructors-of.washington.db

To learn the "Student" target relation using the same training/test partition, 
you should concatenate the following files:
   common.db
   page-words.cornell.db
   page-words.texas.db
   page-words.washington.db
   anchor-words.cornell.db
   anchor-words.texas.db
   anchor-words.washington.db
   neighborhood-words.cornell.db
   neighborhood-words.texas.db
   neighborhood-words.washington.db
   student.cornell.db
   student.texas.db
   student.washington.db
